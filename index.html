        <p>Figure 1: Illustration of WRF-Hydro model system</p>
        <p>When run in an offline or &lsquo;uncoupled&rsquo; mode, WRF-Hydro must read in the meteorological forcing
            data
            necessary to perform land surface model calculations and it contains the necessary routines to do this.
            <br><br> When run
            in
            a coupled mode with WRF or another larger architecture, WRF-Hydro receives meteorological forcing or land
            surface
            states and fluxes from the parent architecture. The basic execution process is as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Upon initialization static land surface physiographic data are read into the WRF-Hydro system and the
                model
                domain and computational arrays are established.</li> <br>
            <li>Depending on whether or not WRF-Hydro is run offline as a stand-alone system or whether it is coupled
                into
                another architecture, either forcing data is read in or land surface states and fluxes are passed in.
            </li><br>
            <li>For offline simulations which require land model execution, the 1-D, gridded land surface model is
                executed.
            </li><br>
            <li>Land surface states and fluxes are then disaggregated to the high resolution terrain routing grids if
                routing is
                activated and there is a difference between the land model grid and the routing grid.</li><br>
            <li>If activated, sub-surface routing physics are executed.</li><br>
            <li>If activated, surface routing physics are executed.</li><br>
            <li>If activated, the conceptual base flow model is executed.</li><br>
            <li>If activated, channel and reservoir routing components are executed.</li> <br>
            <li>Updated land surface states and fluxes are then aggregated from the high resolution terrain routing grid
                to
                the
                land surface model grid.</li> <br>
            <li>Results from these integrations are then written to the model output files and restart files or, in the
                case
                of
                a coupled WRF/WRF-Hydro simulation, passed back to the WRF model.</li><br>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Computer requirements</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>The WRF-Hydro has been developed on a LINUX-based computing platform using Portland Group, gfort and
                ifort
                FORTRAN90
                compilers. To date the model has been ported to the U.S. National Science Foundation IBM supercomputer
                &lsquo;yellowsone&rsquo; located at NCAR, the University of Texas/NSF XSEDE &lsquo;stampede&rsquo;
                supercomputer,
                numerous Linux desktop machines and Linux cluster machines and to the MAC/OS operating system using
                above three
                compilers. <br><br> It has not been rigorously tested on other platforms. When run in full hydrologic
                simulation mode,
                with
                all attendant process modules activated (e.g. overland and subsurface routing, channel and reservoir
                routing,
                and
                baseflow) the WRF-Hydro is a moderately computationally intensive modeling system with respect to other
                physics-based environmental modeling systems (e.g. weather models, climate models, catchment hydrology
                models
                and
                other geophysical fluid dynamics models). <br><br> However, computational requirements scale
                exponentially as functions
                of
                domain size and spatial resolution. Thus there are no firm rules on minimum computational requirements
                in terms
                of
                processor speed or memory allocation. Indeed it is possible and relatively straightforward to set up and
                execute
                simple runs over small basins using a single processor machine with a few hundred megabytes of disk
                space. <br><br>
                However,
                the WRF-Hydro system was designed for large domain, high-resolution applications which require
                significant
                computational, memory and disk storage resources. With these applications in mind, the WRF-Hydro has
                been fully
                parallelized to run on high performance computing systems</p>

            <li><strong>Model setup</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The WRF-Hydro would be run as a fully coupled model to predict and forecast some hydrological processes such
            as
            surface runoff, channel flow, lake/reservoir flow, sub-surface flow and land-atmosphere exchanges. The
            potential
            skill of the model to forecast flood would be examined based on precipitation inputs derived from the
            Weather
            Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The Global Forecasting System (GFS) products would be used as initial
            input to
            drive the WRF model. Although, precipitation from models could possess some systematic errors that are
            associated to
            initial conditions and physical parametization but a sensitivity study would be carried out to calibrate the
            model
            so as to reduce the effect of such error.</p>
        <p>4.1 Numerical configuration</p>
        <p>The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model version 3.9
            would be
            used as a common framework to host the different model physics combinations. The WRF model consist of
            different
            model physics such as microphysics (MP), cumulus parameterization (CU), planetary boundary layer (PBL),
            surface
            layer (SL), land surface (LS), and shortwave and longwave radiation (RAD). Each of these physics has
            different
            parameterization schemes that describe the various complex sub-grid scale processes that cannot be
            represented
            by
            the model resolution. Some schemes would be selected from MP, CU and PBL physics. Comprehensive descriptions
            of
            the
            schemes can be found in Skamarock <em>et al.</em> (2008). The choice of selection is due to the fact that
            the
            physics schemes are not only linked with moisture transport and redistribution in the atmosphere but they
            also
            use
            different approach to represent a specific processes in the atmosphere (Klein <em>et al.</em>, 2015).
            Appropriate
            parent domain covering large region of Nigeria at 15km resolution would be used to host a nested domains.
            The
            nested
            domain will focus on Ogun/Osun catchment area at 4km horizontal resolution.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The combination of CU, MP and PBL physics, which represents the effect of latent heat release through deep
            and
            shallow convection, microphysical cloud and precipitation processes, and vertical turbulent mixing due to
            eddy
            transport, respectively, would be the major consideration in the research framework. This is due to the
            vital
            roles
            they play in precipitation activities within the atmospheric column. The flux profiles of temperature and
            moisture
            within the whole atmospheric column are determined by the PBL scheme. These outputs then serve as input for
            the
            CU
            and MP scheme at every model time step. The CU scheme is responsible for releasing instabilities in the
            atmospheric
            sounding, preventing the MP scheme from generating potentially unrealistic grid-scale convection. In order
            to
            redistribute temperature and moisture towards a stable profile, the CU scheme produces convective
            precipitation.
            Lastly, the MP scheme removes excess atmospheric moisture in case the air is still saturated, which we will
            refer to
            as non-convective precipitation.</p>
